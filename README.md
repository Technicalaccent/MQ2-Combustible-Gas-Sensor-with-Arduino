How do I choose a gas sensor?

There are many different types of gas and smoke sensors available in the market. To choose one you need to refer to its datasheet and check if that particular sensor is meeting your requirements.

What types of gas can I detect with the MQ-2 Gas sensor?

If you check out the datasheet of the device you can observe that this sensor can measure many different types of gasses like Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG),  Methane (CH4), Carbon Monoxide(CO), Alcohol, Smoke (CO2), and Propane but this sensor is mostly sensitive to Hydrogen.

What is ppm for gas?

Parts-per-million, or “ppm”, is commonly used as a fractional unit of measure for concentration. As an example, a methane (molecular) concentration of 2% means that 2 out of every 100 air molecules is methane. Similarly, a methane concentration of 2 ppm means that 2 out of every 1 million air molecules is methane.

Can MQ-2 detect CO2?

A short and simple answer to this question is yes, it can detect CO2. but before making any projects with this sensor please refer to the datasheet of the module to know all outer pareamerts and conditions that are required to measure CO2.

What is the difference between MQ-2 and MQ-5?

MQ-2 can sense methane(CH4) upto 20000 ppm whereas MQ5 can sense methane(CH4) only upto 10000 ppm.

Is this gas sensor analog or digital?

Most of the gas sensors which are available in the market are mostly analog, but it can be made digital with a Op-amp IC and a handful of digital components.
